# Text-Classification-with-TF-IDF-and-Multiple-ML-Algorithms-on-AG-News

# Dataset: AG News Classification
This project uses the AG News Classification Dataset from Kaggle, originally curated by Xiang Zhang et al.

# Description:
The AG News dataset is a collection of over 120,000 news articles categorized into four distinct classes. It is widely used for benchmarking text classification models.

# Dataset Overview:
Total Samples: 127,600

Training Set: 120,000 samples

Test Set: 7,600 samples

Number of Classes: 4

World  – News about international affairs and global events

Sports  – News covering various sports and related activities

Business  – Articles related to finance, economy, and business matters

Sci/Tech  – Science and technology news

Each sample in the dataset includes:

Title: The headline of the news article

Description: A short summary or excerpt of the article

Class Index: Integer label (1–4) indicating the category

# Data Format:
The dataset comes in CSV format with the following columns:

Class Index – Integer (1 to 4)

Title – String (headline of the article)

Description – String (short article excerpt)

# Class Mapping:
Class Index	Category
1	World
2	Sports
3	Business
4	Sci/Tech
